  > Started to preform changes to a more true Entity Component System (ECS).
  > Main ECS changes involve making the Managers have all the methods and the Entity/Components to contain only variables.
  > Changes may take a few days to regain full functionality again but will help with cleanup the project structure
  > Assets locations will be changing and will not longer be seperated by the ScreenType but rather by the type of asset.
